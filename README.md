## Why this project?
Mixed reality is an emerging technology aimed at blending virtual content with the real environment. Using a headset, which can be compared to glasses, it allows virtual content to be displayed at any time, anywhere.
People at the beginning of the dementia continuum are often able and wish to live independently at home. But they may have difficulty finding a solution to satisfy certain needs, planning this solution, or taking the steps to carry it out. These difficulties may impact their ability to continue to live independently at home.
To support independence at home for people at the beginning of the dementia continuum, we are investigating the utility of using a mixed reality headset as a cognitive orthosis. There are several theoretical advantages to using this technology in this context: the headset is able to interpret the context of the person and provide the necessary assistance when needed with appropriate gradation (to stimulate their residual cognitive potential); the assistance is provided in the user’s environment, so they do not need to look away (to a screen for example); the environment does not need to be modified to use it. The design of the cognitive orthosis is based on a user-centered design methodology and follows the “[zero effort technologies](https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00826ED2V01Y201802ARH012)” principles.
As part of this methodology, focus groups have been conducted with occupational therapist to get their insight about the potential use of mixed reality in this context. See [this article for more information](https://rehab.jmir.org/2022/3/e34983).
